This analysis aims to predict the likelihood of loans defaulting based on various financial metrics using machine learning. By leveraging historical loan data, we developed a Logistic Regression model to classify loans into two categories:

Healthy Loan (0): Indicates that the loan is expected to be repaid without default.
High-Risk Loan (1): Indicates a higher probability of defaulting on the loan.
The purpose of this analysis is to help financial institutions manage risks more effectively by identifying potentially risky loans in advance.
